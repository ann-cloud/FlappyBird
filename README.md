# FlappyBird

This Unity project is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game. The game features a bird that the player controls by tapping the screen or pressing a key to navigate through a series of pipes. The objective is to keep the bird flying for as long as possible without colliding with the pipes.

How to Play
- Tap the screen or press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
- Navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.
- Avoid collisions with the pipes.
- The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
